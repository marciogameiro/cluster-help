# Start a Jupyter notebook

You can start a Jupyter notebook on Amarel with the following steps:

* Establish a VPN connection to Rutgers if you are not on campus.

* Go to `https://ondemand.hpc.rutgers.edu` and log in with you NetID and password.

* From the `Interactive Apps` menu on the top or on the side bar select `Personal Jupyter`.

* Choose the `Number of hours`, `Number of cores`, and `Gigabytes of memory` you need.

* Set `Partition` to `main` and `conda path` to the path where your Anaconda is installed ( usually `/home/NetID/anaconda3`). Leave everything else blank.

* Click the `Launch` button.

* Once your resources are allocated click on the blue button `Connect to Jupyter, Anaconda version 5.1.0` to start your Jupyter notebook.

The instructions above are to run your personal Jupyter notebook (that you installed -- usually with Anaconda). If you want to run the Jupyter provided by the system just select `Jupyter Notebook 3` on the third step above.
